# Japanese Haikus

## Classic Haikus

### Matsuo Basho (1644-1694)

An old silent pond...  
A frog jumps into the pond,  
Splash! Silence again.

### Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828)

_O snail_  
Climb Mount Fuji,  
But slowly, slowly!

## Modern Haikus

### Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902)

Toward those short trees  
We saw a hawk descending  
On a day in spring.

*Light of the moon*  
Moves west, flowers' shadows  
Creep eastward.

In the cicada's cry  
No sign can foretell  
How soon it must die.

**Haiku in Nature**

Nature's beauty seen  
In just a few simple words,  
Haiku's power lives.
